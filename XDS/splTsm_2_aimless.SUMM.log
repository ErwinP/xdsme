WARNING WARNING
Anomalous flag switched OFF in input but there appears to be a significant anomalous signal
Estimate of the resolution limit for a significant anomalous signal  8.47A, from the point where the fit drops below threshold 0.15

Estimates of resolution limits: overall
   from half-dataset correlation CC(1/2) >  0.30: limit =  4.58A  == maximum resolution
   from Mn(I/sd) >  1.50:                         limit =  4.80A 
   from Mn(I/sd) >  2.00:                         limit =  5.36A 

Estimates of resolution limits in reciprocal lattice directions:
  Along h k plane

   from Mn(I/sd) >  1.50:                         limit =  4.58A  == maximum resolution
  Along l axis
   from half-dataset correlation CC(1/2) >  0.30: limit =  4.82A 
   from Mn(I/sd) >  1.50:                         limit =  5.61A
